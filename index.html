<h1>A collection of Nell demos</h1>

<p>Here are some banged-together demos of various pieces of
<a href="http://laptop.org">One Laptop per Child</a>'s
<a href="http://cananian.livejournal.com/65077.html">Project Nell</a>.
The ultimate goal is a Nell <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Nell">demo</a>
for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show">CES</a>
in January 2012, but these bits should be considered as tech demos,
benchmarks, and proofs of concept, not actual pieces of that demo (yet).
</p>

<p>Most of these demos require WebGL support.  Visit <a
href="http://get.webgl.org/">get.webgl.org</a> for information about
enabling WebGL in your browser; there is WebGL support in Chrome,
Firefox, Safari, and Opera&mdash;although it often requires enabling
experimental features in the browser preferences.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="tile_test.html">Tiles</a>.  Performance benchmark
  for a tile-based home screen.  "Apps" are "locations" on your world map,
  which you can customize as you like.  (Here's an interesting
  <a href="http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1168">blog entry</a> discussing
  world-creation for kids.)  Day/night would ultimately reflect current
  time, although they've been greatly sped up in this demo.  Lots of
  rough edges and missing UI, but all the textured triangles are
  present, so it should be an accurate benchmark.<br />
  (Drag with left mouse button to rotate, middle mouse button to zoom,
  right mouse button to pan.)
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="nell_home_test.html">Nell at home</a>.  Basic idea
  (including transition) for activities which include dialog with
  Nell or story-telling.<br />
  Standalone model viewers:
  <a href="watchtower_test.html">Castle</a> (from <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/3D-models/architecture/watchtower/">blendswap</a>),
  <a href="sintel_test.html">"Nell"</a> (Sintel, from <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/3D-models/characters/sintel-lite-2-57b/">blendswap</a>),
  <a href="sintel_lite_test.html">Alternate (lightweight) Nell model</a>,
  <a href="maison_test.html">Alternate (heavyweight) house model</a>
  (from <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/3D-models/architecture/little-house/">blendswap</a>).<br />
  In model viewers: drag with left mouse button to rotate, middle
  mouse button to zoom, right mouse button to pan.
  </li>

  <li><a href="music.html">Music maker</a>. Uses WebGL and the Web
  Audio APIs to let you draw and perform music.<br />
  Inspired by Andr&eacute; Michelle's
  <a href="http://lab.andre-michelle.com/tonematrix">ToneMatrix</a> and
  <a href="http://lab.andre-michelle.com/karplus-strong-guitar">Karplus-Strong
  Guitar</a> (see also
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus-Strong_string_synthesis">wiki</a> 
  and this 2008 <a href="http://lac.linuxaudio.org/">Linux Audio Conference</a>
  <a
  href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/realsimple/faust_strings/faust_strings.pdf">paper</a>),
  as well as <a href="http://labs.dinahmoe.com/">DinahMoe</a>'s
  <a href="http://labs.dinahmoe.com/ToneCraft/">ToneCraft</a> and
  the <a href="http://www.global.yamaha.com/tenori-on/">Tenori-on</a>.
  </li>

  <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mr27yY8-A8">Quake on XO-1.75</a>
  (video).
  Of course we need to actually run WebGL with good performance on XO
  hardware.  Jon Nettleton has been working hard on our GL drivers,
  enabling the GPU on the XO-1.75 hardware for the first time.
  This Quake demo shows his progress&mdash;don't worry, Quake is not
  actually part of the Nell demo! (We have a GPU in the XO-1.5 as
  well, which hasn't yet been utilized.)
  </li>

  <li><a href="http://twolivesleft.com/Codify/">Codify</a>&mdash;not
  one of our demos (it's a commercial iPad app) but it demonstrates
  what we'd like to turn <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Pippy">Pippy</a>
  into for Nell.  These improvements probably won't make the January
  demo, though.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coming soon: TurtleArt and Implode for the web.  We've started
  converting them to GTK3 in preparation for hoisting them bodily onto
  the interwebs.  Here's the <a
  href="http://git.sugarlabs.org/~cscott/turtleart/cscott-gtk3/commits/gtk3">source
  code repository for the TurtleArt port</a> if you'd like to watch or
  participate in this hackage.  (See <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a>
  for one of the more unusual ways to get Python running in the web
  context</a>.)</p>
